# algorithm-selection-problem

This repository will gather different algorithms for the **selection problem** in a list. It will highlight the performance of the **Divide to Conquer** paradigm in the context of this problem.

## Introduction to the problem

This problem often follows the problem of sorting list mainly because one of its solutions: **Randomized Selection** hinges on the same method as the one of **Quick Sort**.

### Input

Given a list of n integers: `L = [a1, ..., an]`

### Goal 

We want to return the value of the ith order statistic (i.e. ith smallest element of L)

***Example***: One specific case of this problem is finding the **median**:
- the (n+1)/2th element in n i odd
- the n/2th element if n is even
